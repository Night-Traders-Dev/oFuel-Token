# oQuark Staking Contract

The oQuark staking contract is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to stake their oQuark tokens for a certain period of time and earn interest in return. The staking periods available are 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days, each with a different annual percentage rate (APR).

## How it Works

Users can stake their oQuark tokens by sending them to the staking contract. The contract will lock up the tokens for the chosen staking period and begin accruing interest immediately. At the end of the staking period, the user can withdraw their original tokens plus the earned interest.

The staking periods and their corresponding APRs are as follows:

- 90 days = 5% APR
- 180 days = 7.98% APR
- 365 days = 14.75% APR

## Benefits

- Users can earn a reliable and predictable return on their oQuark tokens.
- The staking contract incentivizes long-term holding and reduces selling pressure on the open market.
- The contract is transparent and auditable, ensuring fairness and security for all participants.

## Risks

- As with any investment, there is always a risk of loss. Users should only stake what they are willing to lose.
- The interest rates are not guaranteed and may change in response to market conditions.
- The oCash network is subject to congestion and high fees, which could affect the user experience and profitability of staking.

## Conclusion

The oQuark staking contract is a simple and secure way for users to earn a reliable return on their oQuark tokens while supporting the long-term growth and stability of the oQuark ecosystem.
